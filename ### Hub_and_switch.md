### Networking Topics
#### Difference between switch and hub
 Hubs and switches are two commonly used networking terms
##### Switch
##### What is a switch?
Switch definition: A switch is a networking device that connects multiple devices on a single computer network. 

You can use a switch to open or close a connection. A signal or power can pass through the connection when the switch is opened. The flow is stopped, and the circuit connection is broken when the switch is closed.

#### Application of switch 
There are various applications of a switch, and some of the most important ones are:

Switch can create a virtual LAN.
A switch maintains a MAC address table.
A switch can also work as a multi-port bridge.
Small office applications make extensive use of switches.
A switch aids in the management of data flow across a network.
A switch can be used to physically connect devices in a computer network.
Switch can send data to any device in either half-duplex or full-duplex mode.

##### Hub

##### What is a hub?
You may be wondering what is a hub and what functions it performs. Let us delve deeper to find answers to these two questions.

Hub definition: A hub is a network device in a computer network where data from various directions converge and are then distributed to various devices.

In layman’s terms, a hub is a device that allows various computers/PCs and other devices to connect to a single network.

A hub sends data packets to all network devices, regardless of whether the data packet contains any MAC addresses. A hub has many ports, and a computer that wants to connect to the network plugs into one of them. When a data frame arrives at a port, the hub broadcasts it to all other ports, regardless of whether it is destined for a specific destination or not.

There are two types of hubs, such as:

##### Active hub: 
This type of hub has its own power supply and can clean, improve, and relay network signals.
##### Passive hub:
 This type of hub collects power from active hub devices as well as wiring from nodes. Aside from that, a hub sends signals into the network without cleaning or boosting them.
##### Applications of hub
There are various applications of a hub, and some of the most important ones are:

Hub is used to monitor networks.
A hub can establish small home networks.
A hub can provide connectivity in organizations
Hub can create a device that is accessible from outside the network.


Key differences between hub and switch 
Let’s go through key differences between switch and hub:

1.A hub is a networking device that connects multiple PCs to a single network, whereas a Switch connects multiple devices on a single computer network.

2.A hub operates on the OSI physical layer, whereas a switch operates on the OSI data link layer.

3.The hub uses a half-duplex cable, whereas the switch uses a full-duplex cable.

4.The switch is an active device, whereas the hub is a passive device.

5.The switch employs the Spanning Tree Protocol to avoid switching loops. On the other hand, the hub cannot avoid switching loops.

6.The hub shares the bandwidth between the ports. A switch, on the other hand, provides dedicated bandwidth to the ports.

7.The number of ports connecting to the device is significantly greater in switches than in the hub.

8.The hub’s data transmission speed is quite slow compared to a switch.

9.A hub network device is difficult to hack, whereas a switch is easily hackable.

10.A hub device is not so popular nowadays, whereas a switch is quite popular and widely used.

11.The switch is an intelligent device as it sends messages to selected destinations, whereas a hub sends messages to all ports.

12.There is only one collision domain in the hub, but different ports have their own collision domain in a switch.
